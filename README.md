# Pre-cancer_Cell-detection
TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor P53 protein, prediction pre-cancer through mutations at tumor protein P53,here we used Artificial Neural Network to predict Cancer or Pre-Cancer which is caused by 2 mutant codons which are 248 and 249 , the prediction pre-cancer must be based on collection datasets (normal TP53 gene and its tumor protein P53), as well as the TP53 database if exist which used for diagnosis and classify the type of malignant mutations and the cancer caused by the tumor protein P53 related to environment that means the prediction is more expressive for the region and will be better as this as have seen from the above impact on the results and how it could affect the environment.
